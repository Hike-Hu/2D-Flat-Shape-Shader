# Flat Shaders!
Lets make a simple 2D shader. Lets make it flat! Flat is good right? Better yet, we'll make the complete development of it public.

This is a Flat Shader designed for 2D games in Unity. It is being actively developed in a YouTube series about writing shaders. The concept began with a simple cutout shader and has progressed from there.
